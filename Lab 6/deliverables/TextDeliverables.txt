Task P3:

The methods that will have to change in order to take into account the new "Discount" service
are,

getServicePoints(), getCalloutFee(), getServiceFee().



Task M8:

In the end the three methods outlined above were not really changed, but rather through the use of @Override,
were tailored for each specific case of ServiceType by updating them to include the variable and class names
that were associated with the service case at hand. That is, I didn't modify the implementations of the three methods
but just changed the variable names to the ones that was part of one of the service types.
